Attempting to improve new player welcome quests.

MT fixes for wooden stairs GregT missed : all Ereubs vareities, Railcraft, Carpenters, Witchwood, and a birch/spruce mixup once Chiseled.

Change Compacting Drawer Recipe to be Galvanized / Steel; from Aluminium / Steel
 - mostly for Tiny Ore handling
 - may restict utility of the Dust Funnel.
   * only handles three of the five dust sizes, with choice of tiny or small in each to pile and block.
   * did it even work on ores?

Update
: Dragon Everything v21c
 - plenty of bugfixes
 - still not compatible with Thaumic Fixer
: GalaxySpace 1.2.5-STABLE
 - continual improvement
: Gregtech 6.08.04
 - Wood stuff *
 - loading times improved
 - config erroring quelled
 * not caring aobut Aether II mod, yet.
 * version checker currently broken, disabled until resolved.
 
Added
: Tweaked inventory Tweaks
 - sorting chests full of ore / samples.

:: mark 1.0r295 ::

repair the errored configs
  - Worldgen mostly
  - Probably due to re-adding galcticraft
Completed (GT) quest writing

Decision
! Declare Release!  WooHoo!
: Automagy Will not Add
 - golem autocraft / sorted storage
   * overlaps AE2 and Logistics Pipes
   * requirement of EEPROM in each golem makes a lackluster choice - just use robots
 - essentia to creature summons
   * worse than RoC stabilized spawners
   * similar to Wrath Cage and Tablet of Necromancy (FM, TT)
 - essentia to block summons
   * very weak version of matter replication
   * why not just quarry
 - redcrystal
   * Expanded Redstone has better logic
   * Signalum wire has equal transmission
   * ELN massively better in both

Issues
 - extremely long pauses in build / load
 - Occasional FML Proxy Packet crash on launch.
   - Quit and reload MineCraft entirely usually works
   - Only still happens to me if the World Load is in the Background
     * Load into world with patience, as the active application window.

Update 
: GT6.08.00
 - IE takes EU
 - some Railcraft stuff
 - Ocean underwater sunlight
 * Apparently the major version is back-end stuff
   * Including the prior 6.07.24 in case of existing worlds breaking for other folks
: Dragon everything v20c
 - Galacticraft might be addable?
 - Grinder / Extractor handle GT6 ore variants by default
 - log spam, hopefully less
 - Thaumic Fixer still isn't compatible
 ! force MTReload - which doesn't work with MTUtilsGT
   * managed to work-around, for now
 
Add
: Expanded Redstone v20a
 - removed the troublesome dependency
: Electrical Age 1.14.2
 - realistic power simulator
 - odd, but very limited, processing
 - analog (LV-microamp) signal processing with rs interchange
 * remove easy rubber
 * remove easy chips
: Galacticraft 3.0.12-504, and GalaxySpace 1.2.4
 - asteroid dimension lighting fixed
 - still has random crashes in Oxygen system
   * these bugs are still unlikey to ever get fixed
