:: mark 2.1.351 ::
Someone tried to add Galacticraft to CurseForge, but was confused about file structure. Do not 'update' it.

Made nuclear more coherent
Fixed some erroring / non-functional tweaks

Writing quest updates. But actually updating the quests file invalidates existing completion in the world.
 + I am including alternate versions of the quest file, so that users can load the one they want.
   go to $instances$/Gregorius hexii Artorus/config/hqm/ and rename any of the quests.hqm-version-x to override the default quests.hqm file there.

Updates:
: GT6.10.07
 - Petroleum Chemistry.
  -- Ethylene and Propylene, steam & catalytic cracked fractions, liquifacted coals, new Plastic recipe
  -- Biomass fractional distillation in the tower
 - Gas Turbine multiblock direct power
 - River Water (infinite fresh water) is worldgen, and an obvious block with WAILA.
  * Drains still work the old way, and RiverWater cannot be picked up by anything (always gives normal fresh Water) [nor can creative mode place it]. It will expand like vanilla water would have.

Added:
: Symcalc 0.14
 - In-game check of Infusion Altar stability rating.

:: mark 2.0.340 ::

Update wood recipes for SawAxe option
Slight change to IE excavator veins

Decision
: Split into version 2 branch
 * config changes greatly transform worldgen
 * re-writen HQM blanks all existing progress

Quests
 - Major changes to first page, for improved on-boarding
  * and some mechanical updates
 - pervasive copyediting
 - add AM2 line
 - replace Atum set

Configs
 - clean up some missed repair from the unstable era

Added:
: Regional Water
 - Now buckets and digging will get also infinite fresh water in Rivers, Twilit Lakes, and on ocean worlds
   * Actually in the biome, so many shore blocks along 'rivers' will not function this way.

Updates
: GregTech 6.10.03
 - included the Erebus woods
 - nicer Creosote treated slabs, and rail ties
 - more metals for Drums, Item Pipes, and Cap-Cell-Containers
 - Axles and Gearboxes !!!
  * RU transmit / split & join / transform / convert to KU pair
 - Anvils- qwertech style: durable hammer-partners for plate / ingot / rolling
 - more miniportals than any sane person would use
 - LuV lightning rod
 - Robot Arms as covers - slot specific insert/extract
 - Turf as peat bogs in Swamps
 - New tier of Burning Boxes that only use charcoal / coal / coke / peat and take liquid Calcite to run
   * Joy to Titanium and Tungstensteel super boiler / turbine / dynamo. And tier 4 HU machines
 - Gas cylinders like measuring pots
 - Cap Nozzle (ball cock) funnel-like for gasses upgrade to the tap-like Nozzles
 - CU _*finally*_ cools down Molds and Basins for automating smeltery casting
 - Button Panel, a temporary manual selector cover

: OpenComputers 1.7.4.1692
: GalaxySpace 1.2.8
: Dragon Everything v22d


:: mark 1.1r307 ::

Attempting to improve new player welcome quests.

MT fixes for wooden stairs GregT missed : all Ereubs vareities, Railcraft, Carpenters, Witchwood, and a birch/spruce mixup once Chiseled.

Change Compacting Drawer Recipe to be Galvanized / Steel; from Aluminium / Steel
 - mostly for Tiny Ore handling
 - may restict utility of the Dust Funnel.
   * only handles three of the five dust sizes, with choice of tiny or small in each to pile and block.
   * did it even work on ores?

Update
: Dragon Everything v21c
 - plenty of bugfixes
 - still not compatible with Thaumic Fixer
: GalaxySpace 1.2.5-STABLE
 - continual improvement
: Gregtech 6.08.04
 - Wood stuff *
 - loading times improved
 - config erroring quelled
 * not caring aobut Aether II mod, yet.
 * version checker currently broken, disabled until resolved.

Added
: Tweaked inventory Tweaks
 - sorting chests full of ore / samples.

:: mark 1.0r295 ::

repair the errored configs
  - Worldgen mostly
  - Probably due to re-adding galcticraft
Completed (GT) quest writing

Decision
! Declare Release!  WooHoo!
: Automagy Will not Add
 - golem autocraft / sorted storage
   * overlaps AE2 and Logistics Pipes
   * requirement of EEPROM in each golem makes a lackluster choice - just use robots
 - essentia to creature summons
   * worse than RoC stabilized spawners
   * similar to Wrath Cage and Tablet of Necromancy (FM, TT)
 - essentia to block summons
   * very weak version of matter replication
   * why not just quarry
 - redcrystal
   * Expanded Redstone has better logic
   * Signalum wire has equal transmission
   * ELN massively better in both

Issues
 - extremely long pauses in build / load
 - Occasional FML Proxy Packet crash on launch.
   - Quit and reload MineCraft entirely usually works
   - Only still happens to me if the World Load is in the Background
     * Load into world with patience, as the active application window.

Update
: GT6.08.00
 - IE takes EU
 - some Railcraft stuff
 - Ocean underwater sunlight
 * Apparently the major version is back-end stuff
   * Including the prior 6.07.24 in case of existing worlds breaking for other folks
: Dragon everything v20c
 - Galacticraft might be addable?
 - Grinder / Extractor handle GT6 ore variants by default
 - log spam, hopefully less
 - Thaumic Fixer still isn't compatible
 ! force MTReload - which doesn't work with MTUtilsGT
   * managed to work-around, for now

Add
: Expanded Redstone v20a
 - removed the troublesome dependency
: Electrical Age 1.14.2
 - realistic power simulator
 - odd, but very limited, processing
 - analog (LV-microamp) signal processing with rs interchange
 * remove easy rubber
 * remove easy chips
: Galacticraft 3.0.12-504, and GalaxySpace 1.2.4
 - asteroid dimension lighting fixed
 - still has random crashes in Oxygen system
   * these bugs are still unlikey to ever get fixed
